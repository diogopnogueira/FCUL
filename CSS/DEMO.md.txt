# Demo

This document provides a step-by-step demonstration example to all software that
was previouly installed and configured as described in the
[requirements](REQUIREMENTS.md) document.

Clone a demonstration project by executing the follow command on the command
line `git clone git@git.alunos.di.fc.ul.pt:css000/css_meta5.git` and then on
Eclipse, File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects and follow the rest
of the wizard.

After importing the project, check the JDK version of `espacoges-web-client` and
and `espacoges-gui-client`. To do so, click on `espacoges-web-client` project
-> `Libraries` tab, and verify the `JRE System Library`. If it is not pointing
to the version installed and configured (as described in the
[requirements](REQUIREMENTS.md) document) update it with the `Edit` option.
Repeat this check for `espacoges-gui-client`.


## Compile the main module and all sub-modules

After importing the project to Eclipse, all modules might not be compiled by
default (it depends on your configurations). To do so:

- Right click on the main module, i.e., `espacoges` project
- Run As -> Maven clean
- Run As -> Maven build... and in Goals write "package" and then press Run
  (The stdout of this command is redirected to the `Console` tab. In case
  Eclipse managed to successfully compile all modules, you should see.)

Analyse the stdout of the last command in the `Console` tab and verify that the
compilation went well, look for the following message "BUILD SUCCESS" at the
end of the stdout.

### Maven vs Eclipse

Eclipse's workspace is not always synced with a maven build. I.e., it might
happen that `Run As -> Maven build...` managed to compile the project
successfully, but Eclipse's workspace complains that there are some compilation
errors. To force Eclipse to sync with the latest maven build, execute the
following set of steps:

- Right click on the main module, i.e., `espacoges` project
- Maven -> Update Project
- Select all `espacoges` modules and then OK

If maven does manage to compile the `espacoges` project and the Eclipse's
workspace keeps reporting compilation issues (even after executing the above
steps), remove the project and re-import it to Eclipse.



## JPA Diagram Editor

As an additional step, check if the
[JPA Diagram Editor](https://wiki.eclipse.org/JPA_Diagram_Editor_Project)
is working properly on Eclipse. To do so, open the `business/Customer` class
from the `espacoges-business` project and verify that the `JPA Structure` tab
shows the class `Customer` with five row, e.g., `id`, `vatNumber`. In addition
to this, on eclipse, right click on `espacoges-business` -> `JPA Tools` ->
`Open Diagram`. Then, right click in the diagram window and
`Show all Persistent Types`. If some entities appear in the diagram window, the
[JPA Diagram Editor](https://wiki.eclipse.org/JPA_Diagram_Editor_Project) and
[Dali Java Persistence Tools](https://www.eclipse.org/webtools/dali) have been
properly configured.



## WebClient

Once all projects compile with success, run the webclient on Eclipse:

- Right click on `espacoges-web-client` project
- Then Run As -> Run on Server

Note: The first Eclipse asks to configure a server, more information on that
in [here (step-4)](https://www.baeldung.com/eclipse-wildfly-configuration#configuring-the-application-server-in-eclipse).
Select `WildFly 10x` as it is the version installed and configured as described
in the [requirements](REQUIREMENTS.md) document.

If everything goes well, Eclipse should open a webview and load
http://localhost:8080/espacoges-web-client/.


## GUIClient

To run the `espacoges-gui-client` execute the following on the command line:

On Windows:
```
cd __path_to_WildFly_installation__\bin
appclient.bat __path_to_css_1819_meta5_project\espacoges-ear\target\espacoges-ear-1.0.ear#espacoges-gui-client.jar
```

On Unix-based Operating System (i.e., Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X):
```bash
cd __path_to_WildFly_installation__/bin
./appclient.sh __path_to_css_1819_meta5_project__/espacoges-ear/target/espacoges-ear-1.0.ear#espacoges-gui-client.jar
```

A graphical user interface of the client should appear in your screen after a
few seconds. If not, try to understand the messages reported by the `appclient`
script executed in this last step and try to fix the issue.


Keep in mind that most of the problems you might face are due to the Java
version enabled in your system. Triple check you have the right version
installed and configured!
